Introduction</h1>
<p>Tic-tac-toe is a game in which two players, X and O, alternate marking spots in a 3x3-square grid. The winner is the player who successfully places three of their markers in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row. It's a solved game with a forced draw, if both players give it their all. It is usually played on paper, but with the advancement of technology, there is now a digital version.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md25"></a>
Research</h1>
<p>With the advancements of the Windows operating system People all around the world began using computers as a source of professional and recreational entertainment in the late 1980s, and the gaming business began to take shape at that time. So I decided to help by creating this game, which will allow individuals to reclaim their lives and pass their free time.</p>
<p>This project's goal is to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game for mobile devices. Because there is no killing in this game, as has been the case in recent years, it will not have an adverse effect on children's brains. The controls are simple enough that anyone of any age can play this game.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md26"></a>
Cost and Features and Timeline</h1>
<p>The cost of the game is decided by the No. of participants requirements. It can be modelled as a game that requires a lot of software. We can add music, animation, and create an End-to-End application. We can make it an internet game that requires a large user database.Because we aim to make a simple game with a minimum user interface for this project, the cost is zero if a computer is available.</p>

<p>The game will provide you single input possibilities (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) to begin with:</p>
<p>1.Player 1 will be assigned 'X' and Player 2 will be assigned 'O'. 2.Player 1 selects a location by pressing entering the number. 3.Player 2 selects a location by pressing entering the number. &gt;</p>
<p>The game reaches a draw, that is, when all nine moves have been performed and no one has won, the game is over.</p>
<p>1.Player 1 is the winner. 2.Player 2 is the winner. </p>
